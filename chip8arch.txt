Atari CHIP-8 Architecture Cheatsheat
======================================

Memory 
--------
CHIP-8 is a 4K 8-bit system which means there was 4096 memory locations and all of them were 8-bit long.
CHIP-8 interpreter itself occupies the first 512 bytes so programs start from memory address 512(0x200) and goes above that but never below.
Also the uppermost 256 bytes (0xF00-0xFFF) for reserve for display refresh and the 96 bytes below that (0xEA0-0xEFF) were reserved for the call stack etc.

Registers
-----------
CHIP-8 has 16 8-bit registers named V0 to VF.
VF register is also used as carry flag.
I is reserved as address register and it's 12-bit wide, used for opcodes that involve memory operations.

Stack
-------
The stack only used to store return addresses when subroutines are called.
The original RCA 1802 version allocated 48 bytes for up to 12 levels of nesting modern implementations usually have more.

Timers
--------
CHIP-8 has two timers. They both count down at 60 hertz, until they reach 0.

Delay timer: This timer is intended to be used for timing the events of games. Its value can be set and read.
Sound timer: This timer is used for sound effects. When its value is nonzero, a beeping sound is made.

Opcodes
---------
CHIP-8 has 35 opcodes, which are all two bytes long and stored big-endian. 

Graphics
----------
CHIP-8 has one instruction that draws sprite to the screen. 
Drawing is done in XOR mode and if a pixel is turned off as a result of drawing, the VF register is set, this is used for collision detection.
The graphics of the CHIP-8 are black and white and the screen has a total of 2048 pixels (64 x 32).
